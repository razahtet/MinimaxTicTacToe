# Minimax TicTacToe
- Web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Minimax algorithm for optimal decision-making so that the computer can play against a human player flawlessly.
- Implemented the difficulty levels (easy medium, and impossible) by adjusting the Minimax algorithm to return lower scores for easier modes allowing the computer to make suboptimal moves.
- Built the game interface using HTML/CSS/JavaScript for an engaging player experience.
